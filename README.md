# 5-Things-to-Know-About-OPG-or-Dental-X-Ray-at-Butler.-08-9544-3999
At Butler Medical Imaging, we understand the importance of precise and high-quality imaging in dental care. One of the most common and essential diagnostic tools we provide is the Dental OPG X-ray in Butler. This imaging technique plays a crucial role in evaluating oral health and assisting dentists in diagnosing and planning treatments. If you have been advised to get an OPG (Orthopantomogram) or a dental X-ray, here are five important things you should know.
1. What is an OPG or Dental X-ray?
An Orthopantomogram (OPG) is a specialised dental X-ray that provides a panoramic view of the upper and lower jaw, including the teeth, temporomandibular joints (TMJ), and surrounding bone structures. Unlike traditional dental X-rays that capture only a small section of the mouth, an OPG captures the entire oral cavity in a single image.
This makes OPG a valuable tool for diagnosing a wide range of dental conditions, including:
•	Tooth decay and cavities
•	Gum disease
•	Impacted wisdom teeth
•	Jaw abnormalities or fractures
•	Cysts and tumors in the jawbone
•	Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD)
A Dental OPG X-ray in Butler is a quick and efficient way for dental professionals to assess oral health and plan appropriate treatments.
2. How Does an OPG Work?
An OPG scan uses low-dose X-ray technology to create a two-dimensional image of your mouth. The procedure involves:
•	Standing or sitting still while placing your chin on a small rest.
•	The machine gently rotates around your head, capturing the full image.
•	The entire process takes approximately 10-15 seconds, with minimal discomfort.
Unlike intraoral X-rays, which require multiple small films inside the mouth, OPGs are taken externally, making them a more comfortable and convenient option for patients of all ages.
3. Why Would You Need a Dental OPG?
Your dentist or oral surgeon may recommend a Dental OPG X-ray in Butler for several reasons, including:
•	Routine dental check-ups: To monitor oral health and detect problems early.
•	Wisdom tooth assessment: To evaluate the position and growth of wisdom teeth.
•	Orthodontic planning: To assess teeth alignment before braces or other orthodontic treatments.
•	Implant and extraction planning: To determine bone density and the best placement for dental implants or extractions.
•	Trauma and jaw conditions: To check for fractures, dislocations, or signs of TMJ disorders.
By obtaining a comprehensive view of the mouth, an OPG allows dentists to diagnose conditions accurately and create effective treatment plans.
4. Is a Dental OPG Safe?
Safety is always a priority when it comes to medical imaging. OPG X-rays are safe and involve a very low dose of radiation, much lower than traditional medical CT scans. The advanced technology used at Butler Medical Imaging ensures that patients receive minimal radiation exposure while still obtaining high-quality images.
If you are pregnant or suspect you may be, inform your dentist or radiologist beforehand. Although the radiation dose is low, precautions can be taken to minimize any potential risks.
5. What to Expect During an OPG Scan?
One of the biggest advantages of an OPG scan is its speed and convenience. Here’s what you can expect during your visit:
Preparation: There is no special preparation needed. You may be asked to remove any metal objects (such as jewelry or glasses) that could interfere with the imaging.
Positioning: You will be guided to stand or sit in front of the machine, resting your chin on a support.
Scanning Process: The scanner will move around your head while capturing the images. It is completely painless and takes just a few seconds.
Results: The images are available shortly after the scan and are sent to your dentist or specialist for review and diagnosis.
